# Browser UMOD Extractor

A simple html page that allows you to extract any v1 UMOD straight in your browser without having to download anything or send any file over the internet.

## Cloning

You can use the folowing command to clone the repo and grab the submodules:

```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aziascreations/Browser-UMOD-Extractor.git```

## Usage

Simply open the html file and follow the instructions on screen.

Or you can go on [GitHub pages](https://aziascreations.github.io/Browser-UMOD-Extractor/) to test it.

## Integration

If you want to add this page one your website, you will just have to add your elements to the page, add a link to your stylesheet and maybe fix the links for the js files.

And if you just want to host it without modifying it, you can simply put the content of the repo in a directory.<br>
The paths for the js files and css file are relative and shouldn't cause any problem regardless of where you host the page.
